# scrape_usgs: _scraping US Geological Survey gages_

This repository is under development!

The goal is to scrape the USGS peak flow and other gage values and save them in an .txt or other file for futher analysis. This could be an automated process where a single vector of gage numbers could up sent to the function and all the desired information could easily be downloaded and saved. The gage numbers would have to be determined separately.
